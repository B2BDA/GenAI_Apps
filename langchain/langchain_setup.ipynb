      "content=\"MDR in credit card stands for **Merchant Discount Rate**. It's the fee a merchant (business) pays to their bank or payment processor for the service of accepting credit and debit card payments from customers.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown:\\n\\n*   **Who pays it?** The merchant (the business selling the goods or services).\\n*   **Who receives it?** It's typically split between the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank), the card network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.), and the issuing bank (the customer's bank).\\n*   **What does it cover?** It covers the costs associated with processing the transaction, including:\\n    *   **Interchange fees:** These are set by the card networks and paid to the issuing bank to cover the risk of fraud and other costs. Interchange fees make up the largest portion of the MDR.\\n    *   **Assessment fees:** These are fees charged by the card networks (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) for using their brand and network.\\n    *   **Processor fees:** These are fees charged by the payment processor for their services, such as transaction processing, fraud prevention, and customer support.\\n\\n**Factors that influence MDR:**\\n\\n*   **Type of card:** Premium cards (e.g., rewards cards, corporate cards) typically have higher MDRs than basic cards.\\n*   **Type of transaction:** Card-present transactions (where the customer physically swipes or inserts their card) usually have lower MDRs than card-not-present transactions (e.g., online purchases, phone orders).\\n*   **Merchant category:** Some industries are considered higher risk and may have higher MDRs.\\n*   **Merchant's transaction volume:** Merchants with higher transaction volumes may be able to negotiate lower MDRs.\\n*   **Acquiring bank:** Different acquiring banks may offer different MDR rates.\\n\\n**In simple terms:**\\n\\nThink of MDR as a commission the merchant pays for the convenience and security of accepting credit and debit card payments. It allows them to reach a wider customer base and potentially increase sales, but it comes at a cost.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--0d6fa71b-35a6-4990-bbb8-ed21f044425b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7, 'output_tokens': 437, 'total_tokens': 444, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
